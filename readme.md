# Bay Wheels Usage Patterns 2019
## by Amir Ragab


## Dataset

> Bay Wheels(formerly known as Ford GoBike) is a regional public bicycle sharing system in the San Francisco Bay Area, California. Beginning operation in August 2013 as Bay Area Bike Share,
 the Ford GoBike system currently has over 2,600 bicycles in 262 stations across San Francisco, East Bay and San Jose. On June 28, 2017, the system officially launched as Ford GoBike in a partnership with Ford Motor Company. 
Our goal is to explore the difference in usage patterns between subscribers and customers in 2019. The dataset I am using is the combined monthly data in 2019, which I cleaned and concatenated from the individual monthly data.

## Summary of Findings

> The number of rides peaked around early morning and before sunset, with bikes being used more during weekdays compared to weekends. The most popular seasons were early spring, late summer, and fall, probably due to the weather.
There were some outliers in the ride duration variable, but most rides were between 5 and 15 minutes. Most of the rides seemed to start in weekdays, with rides starting early in the morning and before sunset.
The bikes were probably used for commuting to and from work. With the most popular months being early in the spring and the late summer and in the fall. With december having no data, probably having to do with the coronavirus.
Overall, there was a lot more subscribers than customers, subscribers seem to ride bikes more in weekdays than weekends, probably to ride to work. Customer rides tend to increase in weekends,
probably because they tend to engage in tourism or leisurely rides. Subscribers tend to use bikes for a shorter duration than customers, and usage peaks around march and april.

## Key Insights for Presentation

> Different usage pattern/habit between the two type of riders are: Subscribers use the system mainly on work days (Monday through Friday) whereas customers ride a lot on weekends,
especially in the afternoon. Rides concentrated around 8-9am and 17-18pm on work days for subscribers, while customers tend to use more in the late afternoon around 17pm Monday to Friday. 
The period of usage for subscribers were short compared to customers, indicating the use is primarily for work commute. 
The more flexible pattern of customer use shows that their use is mostly over weekends and in the afternoon, probably for leisure purposes.
